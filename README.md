## Introduction

This project provides implementations of the Euler and RK4 methods, which are numerical techniques used to approximate the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Both methods are first-order numerical methods, but RK4 is more accurate and commonly used for solving ODEs in practice.

### Features

- Implementation of Euler method for numerical integration
- Implementation of Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method for numerical integration
- Command-line interface for specifying ODEs and initial conditions
- Visualization of results using plotting libraries (optional)

## Installation
